## How to Deploy to GitHub Pages

### Option 1: Simple Upload (Easiest)

2. Upload all files from this folder to the `main` branch.
3. Go to **Settings** > **Pages**.
4. Under **Build and deployment** > **Source**, select **Deploy from a branch**.
5. Select the `main` branch and `/ (root)` folder.
6. Click **Save**. Your site will be live at `https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo-name>/`.

### Option 2: Automatic Deployment (Best)
The project includes a GitHub Action in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`.
